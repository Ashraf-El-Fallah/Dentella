# Dentella

Dentella is an innovative Android application designed to bridge the gap between dentistry students and patients in need. It serves as a platform where dental students can find patients to practice their skills, and patients who cannot afford professional dental care can connect with these students for free or at a minimal cost.

# Project Overview
Dentella aims to:

1-Assist dentistry students in gaining practical experience by connecting them with patients.

2-Help patients who cannot afford professional dental care to find affordable or free treatment options.

3-Provide users with valuable information on dental health through articles.

4-Offer an AI model to predict potential dental diseases before they occur.

5-Allow patients to post requests for dental care and manage these posts once they find a suitable dentist.

6-Enable patients to browse available dentists across various dental specialities.

7-Support multiple languages, including Arabic, to cater to users who may not be proficient in English.

8-Allow dentists to create profiles, list their specialties and availability, add informative articles, and manage their patient interactions.

# Features

1-User Roles: Separate interfaces for patients and dentists.

2-Article Management: Users can read and save articles related to dental health.

3-AI Disease Prediction: Predict potential dental issues before they develop.

4-Patient Posts: Patients can post and delete requests for dental care.

5-Dentist Profiles: Dentists can create profiles, list their availability, and add articles.

6-Multilingual Support: Options to switch the app's language to Arabic.
